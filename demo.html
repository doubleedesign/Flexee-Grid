<h1>Flexee Grid Test</h1>

<h2>Option 1: Apply a class to a row and the columns inside will size accordingly, wrapping onto a new line if there's more.</h2>

<p>Default classes are "row-of-x", then if you need it to change as the screen size changes, additional classes can be added to change at a specified breakpoint. e.g. "row-of-4 tablet-row-of-8" with 8 columns inside it will be 2 rows of 4 up until the tablet breakpoint, then it will change to one row of 8. You can adjust at as many of the set breakpoints as you need.</p>

<h3>row-of-1</h3>
<div class="row-of-1">
	<div class="column"><p>You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.</p></div>

    <div class="column"><p>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency.</p></div>

<h2>Option 2: Apply classes to the columns so they don't all have to be the same width.</h2>
<h3>row</h3>
<div class="row">
	<div class="start-12 medium-6 tablet-4 large-12 columns">
    	<p><strong>start-12 medium-6 tablet-4 large-12 columns</strong></p>
